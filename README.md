## Steam Description
 For a more Relaxed Brotato Experience try BOTato, enable the auto-battler in the mod menu (options -> mods) and the game will play itself.

 The in-game controls will be replaced with a bot that tries to maintain a good distance from enemies, you just pick weapons and items and let the good times roll.
